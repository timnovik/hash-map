# hash map
This is a hash map with Robin-Hood hashing.

.cpp file contains stdin/out interface with following options:

1. "+ k x" to add pair _k: x_ to map.
2. "- k" to erase elem with key _k_ from map.
3. "? k" to find and print value with key _k_ (or _-1_ if there aren't key _k_).
4. "<" to print all keys with values.
5. "!" to clear hash map.
